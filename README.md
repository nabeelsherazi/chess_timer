# Bullet Chess Timer

## About

Since literally zero of these exist on the internet somehow, I wrote a quick chess timer for a fixed move-time variant of bullet chess (aka lightning chess). It's built on Pygame and can be edited pretty easily by changing the values of the variables declared.

## Installation

If you are new to programming and just want to use this thing, you must have both Python and the Pygame library installed to run this program. You can get Python from [here](https://www.python.org/) and you can install Pygame with the command `pip install pygame`. Then just double click on the timer to run it.

## Use

The timer is by default set to 5 second move intervals, but this, as well as other details of the program (colors, etc) can be changed pretty easily by changing values of the variables. Press spacebar to start the timer, and then press space when your move is over to pass to the other player.

## Bugs

There are literally no bugs in this program I guarantee it. It's like 80 entire lines my guy.
